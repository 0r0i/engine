## Overview

Lightweight Customizable Chain For All

The it-chain is an easily modifiable block chain that can fit into any domain. To make it easier to customize, we have divided the it-chain into several independent components and minimized dependencies between them.

**The development is not completed yet. The beta version will be released in August.**
